As a data analyst for the Kansas City Chiefs you have been given a dataset containing information about the players,
 their positions, and some game statistics.

Let's start analyzing!

Create a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a player. Include attributes such as 'name,
' 'position,' and 'jersey number.'
Print out a list of all player positions in the dataset.
Choose a player and update their game statistics in the dataset.
Calculate the average statistics (e.g., yards gained, touchdowns) for all players and print the results.
Congratulations for reaching the end of this chapter! Using data structures, you were able to organize and
analyze data for the Chiefs ðŸ˜Ž. Think of all the things you can analyze!

âœ¨Just remember practice makes perfectâœ¨.

In the next chapter, we'll explore file input/output in Python. Hope you can handle it! ðŸ‘€
