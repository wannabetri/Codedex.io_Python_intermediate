Time to practice with strings! You will:

Write test cases to validate specific behaviors.
Use assertion methods to verify expected outcomes.
First, let's start by creating a new string_utils.py file.

Next, define the following functions:

def reverse_string(s):
  return s[::-1]

def capitalize_string(s):
  return s.capitalize()

def is_capitalized(s):
  return s[0].isupper()

Now, let's write some unit tests. Create another Python file named test_string_utils.py.

Then, import the three functions we defined in string_utils.py:

Define a test class TestStringUtils that inherits from unittest.TestCase.
Write test methods inside TestStringUtils to validate each imported function.
Use assertion methods to test each function, including .assertEqual() and .assertTrue().

Note: Make sure to use the if __name__ == '__main__' statement that uses unittest.main().

Finally, run the unit tests with python3 test_string_utils.py. For the s string parameter, maybe try your name or favorite snack!
