âœ¨ Here at CodÃ©dex, we are ðŸ¤© big fans of music ðŸŽ¹. The only thing better than a perfect playlist is a playlist with all your favorite songs. Let's create a Python script that organizes the songs into a .txt file. Let's make a playlist!

First, let's define a dictionary to store liked songs:

liked_songs = {
  'title': 'artist'
}

Next, create a function to display and write liked songs to a file:

def write_liked_songs_to_file(liked_songs, file_name):

Open the file in write mode.
Write each song and artist by iterating through the liked_songs dictionary.
Your liked_songs.txt file should look something like this:

Liked Songs:
Bad Habits by Ed Sheeran
I'm Just Ken by Ryan Gosling
Mastermind by Taylor Swift
Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars
Ghost by Justin Bieber
