Thanks to the internet, we can connect with friends across the world. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

When you and your friends are scattered across different cities, sharing locations is something that can help you feel closer. 🫶

Let's use latitude and longitude 🌐 to create tuples of our friends locations!

Create a tuple for the city you are in.
Create 3 tuples for your friends, each with the latitude and longitude of the cities they live in.
Print the locations of all your friends.
Which of your friends is the furthest away?

Hit "Complete" to feel closer than ever with your friends. 🥰

Bonus: Combine all the tuples into one tuple.
