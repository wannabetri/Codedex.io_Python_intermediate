🍎 Welcome to NYC! 🗽

As one of the cultural capitals of the world, NYC is the home of the Met Museum.

It has one of the biggest art collections in the world! 🗺️

Let’s catalog an artifact from the museum! 🖼️ 👩‍🎨

First, search the Met Museum site for your favorite artifact. Scroll to "Artwork Details" and let's start cataloging.

On the Python editor, create a dictionary with the information of your artifact, including:

artist
period
date
Lastly, print the dictionary. What do you see? What if we just want to print the keys, or the values?
